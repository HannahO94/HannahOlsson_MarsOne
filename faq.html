                            Why on earth would anyone move to Mars?

                            The short answer is. Because we can. Why did
                            Columbus travel west? Why did Marco Polo head east?
                            Because it is that pull, that unknown, that prospect
                            of adventure that compels humans to seek new
                            frontiers to explore.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Sending a manned mission to Mars is a fantastic
                            adventure. Imagine living on another planet,
                            millions of miles from the Earth; looking up into
                            the sky with the knowledge that one of the 'stars'
                            is actually the planet you were born on. Who can
                            even envision the incredible feeling of being the
                            first human in history to step out of the capsule
                            and leave your footprint on the surface of Mars? By
                            this we implore you to not just think of that
                            feeling for the astronaut, but the experience for
                            all those watching back home. Those who observed
                            Neil Armstrong land on the Moon all those years ago
                            still remember every detail â€“ where they were, who
                            they were with and how they felt. The moment the
                            first astronauts land on Mars will be our moment to
                            remember.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            A second reason is good, old-fashioned curiosity.
                            Where did Mars come from? Can it teach us about
                            Earth's history? Is there life on Mars? These are
                            just three of the hundreds of burning questions for
                            scientists all over the world.

                            The trip to Mars cannot be called risk free. Like
                            any venture in any means of travel, there are always
                            things that could go wrong. In the case of Mars One,
                            the following risks are conceivable:

                            Although traveling to Mars will evidently bring
                            risks, if you were to compare our mission to the
                            first Moon mission in 1969, it quickly becomes
                            apparent that this mission is much safer.

                            The trip takes around seven months; a bit longer
                            than astronauts currently stay on the International
                            Space Station. The precise duration of each journey
                            depends on when it is taken. Because both Mars and
                            Earth's orbits are not perfectly circular, the time
                            it takes to travel between them varies from six to
                            eight months. When determining the course to Mars,
                            the maximum travel time for the astronauts is very
                            important.
